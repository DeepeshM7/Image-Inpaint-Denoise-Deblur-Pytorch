I have used fully convolutional approach using Decoder for image generation but the activation employed is **Gated_Activation** ,as proposed in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05328"> Conditional Image Generation with PixelCNN Decoders</a> ,without the sequential masked convolution approach(which is slow).

</br>
Advantages: </br>
<b>
(i)Good Quality Results</br>
(ii)Time-efficient Approach
</b>
</br>

I have also tested an equivalent decoder with Relu activation and can say that the Gated_Activation produces superior results.

# Methedology
Vector Quantized -Variational Auto Encoder (**VQ-VAE**) is trained to reconstruct the Input, post training VQ-VAE all its parameters are freezed, it's then used to encode the input to discrete latent embeddings, then a Convolutional Decoder is trained to construct the noise -free, blur-free and inpainted Image.

# Data Preparation
The Dataset used for this project is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/arnaud58/flickrfaceshq-dataset-ffhq"> Flickr-Faces-HQ Dataset (FFHQ)</a> available on Kaggle.
</br>
</br>
To mimic real world scenario random white lines are drawn on the dataset while injecting random "Salt & Pepper" Noise and then randomly introducing one of ['average','gaussian','median'] blurring of different magnitutdes.
